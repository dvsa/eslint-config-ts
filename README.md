# eslint-config-ts
Shareable ESLint config for use in Node/Typescript projects.

### Why?
Rather than having to copy linter config files across code repos of the same project/tech stack, can pull in a standard shared config and dependencies from a single place and manage any changes/updates centrally.

### Rules
This config uses:
- Airbnb style guide rules (adapted for Typescript): https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
- ESLint Typescript plugin recommended rules: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin
- ESLint security plugin rules: https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security

A few of the default rules are switched off/customised as specified in the config in `index.js`.

### Usage
1. Install the config in your project\*. You'll also need to install Typescript and ESLint yourself if not already installed.

    `npm install --save-dev @dvsa/eslint-config-ts`

2. Add a `.eslintrc` to your project root extending the config:

    ```
    {
        "extends": "@dvsa/eslint-config-ts"
    }
    ```

    If you need to override the shared config in any way to suit your specific project, for example by customising certain rules, you can do so here. See the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring "ESLint documentation") for details.

3. Add a `.eslintignore` to specify any project directories/files to exclude from the linter. ESLint already ignores `node_modules` by default.

4. Run the linter:

    `(npx) eslint --ext .js,.ts .`

    The `--ext` option is required to tell ESLint to lint `.ts` files (lints only `.js` by default) and `.` specifies the files/directory to lint.

If you are using VSCode, you can add the ESLint extension to see lint issues as you type. You might also want to add a pre-push hook to your project such that the linter runs on pushing code and fails the push if there are unresolved issues.

\*It is recommended to use npm6 or higher. Using a lower version of npm may cause issues due to the way dependencies are loaded. Also, if you have any of the project's dependencies (see `package.json`) already installed in your project, perhaps for an old eslint config, it is best to uninstall them first to avoid possible conflicts.

------------

This shared config was  originally made by the FTTS (Future Theory Test Service) team for use across our different project repos using a Node/Typescript/Jest stack. To suit your project you may need to configure the `env` property in your `.eslintrc` for your specific tech stack.
